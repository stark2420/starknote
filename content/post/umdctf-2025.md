2025/4/26 07:00(JST) - 2025/4/28 07:00(JST)で開催された UMDCTF 2025 に参加した．

<!--more-->
個人で参加し，結果は，536 点で 708 チーム中 386 位だった．以下大会期間中に自分で解けた問題には✔をつけている．

### ✔ deobfuscation (111pt [390 Solves])
> the chall is not that complex. the key is to read ASSEMBLY!  
flag  

Ghidraでflagファイルを静的解析する．

./ghidraRun で実行し，プロジェクトを選択後，File > import File... からflagファイルを選択する．  

```c
void processEntry entry(void)

{
  long i;
  long j;
  
  syscall();
  syscall();
  for (i = 0; (&DAT_0040209c)[i] != 10; i = i + 1) {
    (&DAT_0040211c)[i] = (&DAT_0040209c)[i] ^ (&DAT_00402034)[i];
  }
  if (i == 0x34) {
    i = 0;
    do {
      j = i;
      if ((&DAT_00402000)[j] != (&DAT_0040211c)[j]) goto LAB_0040109a;
      i = j + 1;
    } while (j + 1 < 0x34);
    (&DAT_0040209d)[j] = 0;
    syscall();
  }
  else {
    LAB_0040109a:
    syscall();
  }
  syscall();
                    /* WARNING: Bad instruction - Truncating control flow here */
  halt_baddata();
}
```

入力値`&DAT_0040209c`と鍵`&DAT_00402034`とをXORした結果と，値`&DAT_00402000`が一致するかを求めるプログラムである．
なので，鍵`&DAT_00402034`と値`&DAT_00402000`をXORしてあげればよさそう．

鍵`&DAT_00402034`と値`&DAT_00402000`は16進で値が確認できる．

Ghidraで値のコピーは，範囲選択後，右クリック > Copy Special... > Python List などで可能．  
データ型を変えたい場合は，範囲選択後，右クリック > Data > TerminatedUnicode などで可能．

```python
DAT_00402000 = [0x20, 0x22, 0x20, 0x26, 0x35, 0x37, 0x14, 0x07, 0x46, 0x00, 0x5a, 0x17, 0x44, 0x35, 0x52, 0x0c, 0x70, 0x28, 0x37, 0x1c, 0x5b, 0x1d, 0x70, 0x16, 0x76, 0x50, 0x69, 0x5c, 0x6e, 0x6c, 0x1b, 0x12, 0x54, 0x69, 0x2d, 0x38, 0x06, 0x23, 0x11, 0x3d, 0x2f, 0x00, 0x02, 0x4a, 0x68, 0x45, 0x3b, 0x64, 0x1a, 0x20, 0x55, 0x05]
DAT_00402034 = [0x75, 0x6f, 0x64, 0x65, 0x61, 0x71, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x75, 0x76, 0x69, 0x45, 0x60, 0x70, 0x7f, 0x65, 0x54, 0x77, 0x63, 0x74, 0x68, 0x42, 0x53, 0x54, 0x45, 0x03, 0x3d, 0x7f, 0x31, 0x58, 0x75, 0x46, 0x75, 0x44, 0x60, 0x78, 0x6a, 0x74, 0x51, 0x4f, 0x1c, 0x5f, 0x76, 0x79, 0x0b, 0x2d, 0x75, 0x45, 0x4b, 0x55, 0x66, 0x78]

result = [a ^ b for a, b in zip(DAT_00402000, DAT_00402034)]
unicode_str = ''.join(chr(r) for r in result)
print(unicode_str)
# UMDCTF{r3v3R$E-i$_Th3_#B3ST#_4nT!-M@lW@r3_t3chN!Qu3}
```

Pythonを実行するとflagが得られた．

`UMDCTF{r3v3R$E-i$_Th3_#B3ST#_4nT!-M@lW@r3_t3chN!Qu3}`

これはPythonにおける複数の比較演算子の連結記法（連鎖比較; chained comparison）であり，`z3-solver`を用いることで解くことが出来そう．

```python
!pip install z3-solver

import re
from z3 import *

def parse_constraint(line, s):
    tokens = re.findall(r's\[\d+\]|\d+|==|!=|>=|<=|>|<', line)

    # s[...]や数字をZ3のオブジェクトに変換する
    def resolve(token):
        if token.startswith('s['):
            index = int(token[2:-1])
            return s[index]
        else:
            return int(token)

    conditions = []
    for i in range(0, len(tokens) - 2, 2):
        left = resolve(tokens[i])
        op = tokens[i + 1]
        right = resolve(tokens[i + 2])
        
        # Z3 の比較式を構築
        if op == '==':
            cond = left == right
        elif op == '!=':
            cond = left != right
        elif op == '>':
            cond = left > right
        elif op == '<':
            cond = left < right
        elif op == '>=':
            cond = left >= right
